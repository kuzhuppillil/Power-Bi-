## Project 1: Data Manipulation and Reporting with Power BI

    Using Power BI, I worked on a project that involved manipulating and reporting on Zomato's restaurant data. The project included tasks such as data transformation, data blending, creating visualizations for restaurant comparisons, analyzing average ratings and costs, and designing a multi-page report with easy navigation.
